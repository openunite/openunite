# OpenUnite
OpenUnite is a distributed open source tool to gather people together to do an activity. It supports groups of any size, no matter if they're meeting once or on a frequent basis. Handles paid events and sponsors if needed.

OpenUnite's API is federated, meaning anybody can host an OpenUnite hub and share groups and events with other hubs.
